## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'channeltalk-ruby-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install channeltalk-ruby-client

## Usage

### Configuration

Before making requests, you must configure the gem with your key
and secret. If you are using Rails, you can do this in an initializer.

```ruby
Channeltalk.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "YOUR API KEY"
  config.api_secret = "YOUR API SECRET"
  config.timeout = 10
  config.debug = false
end
```

### API
```ruby
* Channeltalk::Api::User.create_user(params: params)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
